In this machine learning project, I aim to predict loan status using various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using Randomized Search CV to optimize the performance of each model. The project involves preprocessing the dataset, feature selection, model training, and evaluation to identify the best performing classifier.
